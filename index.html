            <p> My name is Gabriel Vezina and I am from Montréal,Québec.

                I recently completed my psychology bachelors at Concordia University. With that said, I am still an
                ambitious student
                completing an associates
                diploma in social media marketing. While completing the diploma, I am also in the process of applying to
                grad schoool within JMSB's Buisiness Administration program. At the end of my academic career, I hope to
                become a public relations specialist any other closly related field. </p>

            <P>Outside academics and work, I like to read often, go to the gym, go out for runs, learn digitally related
                skills such as web layouts and from time to time
                attempt to acquire new languages.
            </P>

        <p>As a psychology undergraduate student at Concordia University, I have had the privilege to
            study the
            fundamental facets of human emotion,cognition and behavior. With this in mind, the
            undergraduate
            program has
            also given me opportunities to pursue my learning more actively and get involved with the
            mental
            health
            community in innovative ways. Notably, I have had the opportunity to directly apply my
            knowledge at
            the
            provincial psychology case competitions as both a contender and eventually as a coach for
            Concordia’s
            neuroscience team. Within the 2018-2019 academic year, I had the honor to be elected as the
            finance
            coordinator for the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association. Along with my team, I
            have
            organized
            academic workshops, networking events and charity campaigns. These experiences provided me
            with
            opportunities to enhance my theoretical knowledge and have exposed me to the basis of public
            relations,
            event planning and financial management.

            Nowadays, I am currently completing an associates diploma in social media marketing while
            also
            applying for
            grad school for this upcoming in Buisiness Administration.

            <p>Outside of academics, I have had the good fortune to expand my skill set outside of the undergraduate
                field.
                Over the course of the summer of 2019, I have had the honor to teach english as a second
                language at the Bouchereau Lingua International in Montreal. Throughout my time, I taught children from
                the ages of eight to sixteen and from a variety of nationalities. Given this expirience, I have a chance
                to hone in on presentational skills as well as apply some of the fundamentals of learning theory through
                creating the class as dynamic as it could be. </p>
            <p>Prior to teaching, I also had the
                privilege to work for a canadian youth tourism company called ILOVETRAVEL. Throughout the summers of
                2017 and 2018, I was
                able to work abroad as trip leader in the Domincan Republic and as an airport coordinator in
                montreal.Given these experiences, I was able to further hone my, leadership,communication and pragmatic
                organizational skills
                in a creative manner.</p>
            <p>
                Even though, the job expiriences mntioned above are tad unconventional, I have learned a great deal
                about going for the
                opportunites as the come and be resourceful. </p>
