            <p> My name is Gabriel Vezina and I am from Montréal,Québec.

                I recently completed my psychology bachelors at Concordia University. With that said, I am currently
                completing and associates
                diploma in social media marketing. While completing the diploma, I am also in the process of applying to
                grad schoool within JMSB's Buisiness Administration program. At the end of my academic career, I hope to
                become a public relations specialist. </p>

            <P>Outside academics and work, I like to read, learn new skills and from time to time acquire new languages

        <p>As a psychology undergraduate student at Concordia University, I have had the privilege to
            study the
            fundamental facets of human emotion,cognition and behavior. With this in mind, the
            undergraduate program has
            also given me opportunities to pursue my learning more actively and get involved with the
            mental health
            community in innovative ways. Notably, I have had the opportunity to directly apply my
            knowledge at the
            provincial psychology case competitions as both a contender and eventually as a coach for
            Concordia’s
            neuroscience team. Within the 2018-2019 academic year, I had the honor to be elected as the
            finance
            coordinator for the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association. Along with my team, I
            have organized
            academic workshops, networking events and charity campaigns. These experiences provided me
            with
            opportunities to enhance my theoretical knowledge and have exposed me to the basis of public
            relations,
            event planning and financial management.

            Nowadays, I am currently completing an associates diploma in social media marketing while
            also applying for
            grad school for this upcoming in Buisiness Administration.

            <p>Outside of academics, I have had the good fortune to expand my skill set outside of undergraduate field.
                Over the course of summer 2019, I have had the honor to teach english as a second
                language at the Bouchereau Lingua International in Montreal. Throughout my time, I taught children from
                the ages of ten to sixteen and from a variety of nationalities. Prior to teaching, I also had the
                privilege to work for a canadian youth tourism company called ILOVETRAVEL. Throughout two summers, I was
                able to work abroad as trip leader in the Domincan Republic and as an airport coordinator in
                montreal.Given these experiences, I was able to further hone my communication and organizational skills
                in a creative manner.</p>
